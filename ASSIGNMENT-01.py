# In second year computer engineering class, group A studentâ€™s 
# play cricket, group B students play badminton and group C 
# students play football. 
# Write a Python program using functions to compute 
# following: - a) List of students who play both cricket and 
# badminton b) List of students who play either cricket or 
# badminton but not both c) Number of students who play 
# neither cricket nor badminton d) Number of students who 
# play cricket and football but not badminton. (Note- While 
# realizing the group, duplicate entries should be avoided, Do 
# not use SET built-in functions)
